The scene can be configured by uploading a JSON file (camera_config.json) containing the following parameters:

    outputPath: path to the folder where data will be saved (must already exist)
    num_samples: number of eye images to capture over the noise parameters for all cameras
    headless_mode: show (0) or hide (1) the User Interface after selecting "Start Generation"
    motion_center: use the center of the first camera (0) or use a relative offset from the eye (1) as the center of motion noise about the eye
    camera_array_center (optional): if motion_center is 1, then this must be defined. x, y, z, rx, ry, and rz correspond to meters and Euler angle degrees about the coordiante axes, where z is defined as forward, y is down, and x is to the right relative to the eye's point of view
    camera_array_center_noise: uniform noise for each of the 6 camera array center parameters (defined as Â± provided value)

    cameras: list of cameras, each with the following parameters:
        name: name of the camera that will be used to define the output file name for each view from that camera in the output dataset
        noise_distribution: "uniform", or "gaussian", corresponding to the noise of each camera's intrinsics, respectively
        is_orthoraphic: perspective (false) or orthographic (true)
        intrinsics: parameters to define the camera's imaging, with focal lengths fx and fy, camera center positions cx and cy, and width (w) and height (h), all in pixels. These can be determined from intrinsics calibration or camera specifications.
        intrinsics_noise: noise parameters for each of the 6 intrinsic parameters
        extrinsics: world position of the camera with respect to the camera_array_center f motion_center is 1. Otherwise, the world position fo the camera in eye coordiantes

    lights: list of point light sources (more light sources in development) in the scene, each with the following parameters
        name: light source name to be included in the output json file detailing the ground truth position of each light source
        type: "point" is the only option available currently
        array_mounted: if 0, light source is positioned relative to the eye. If 1, light source is positioned relative to the motion_center or the first camera if motion_center is not set. If 1, noise will be applied to the position of the light source, similarly to the cameras.
        position: 3D position in x, y, and z relative to camera_array_center (if array_mounted = 1) or relative to the eye (if array_mounted = 0).
        position_noise: noise added to the light source position (x, y, z) in addition to any noise applied by the camera_array_center if array_mounted is 1.
        properties: includes range, intensity, color (r,g,b), shadows, and shadow_bias, all defined in the Unity docs for light sources.

    eye_parameters:
        pupil_size_range: min and max values for the clamped uniform distribution range of the pupil size (in meters)
        iris_size_range: min and max values for the clamped uniform distribution range of the iris size (in meters)
        default_yaw: 0 corresponds to the optical axis aligned with the z axis of the eye. Changing this value will set the center of eye noise to an offset optical direction, rotating about the x axis of the eye(degrees). Note: appropriate physiological yaw range is approximately between -30 and 30 degrees.
        default_pitch: 0 corresponds to the optical axis aligned with the z axis of the eye. Changing this value will set the center of eye noise to an offset optical direction, rotating about the y axis of the eye (degrees). Note: appropriate physiological pitch range is approximately between -45 and 45 degrees.
        yaw_noise: noise, in degrees, about the default_yaw of the eye
        pitch_noise: noise, in degrees, about the default_pitch of the eye

See camera_config.json for an example of the camera configuration.
